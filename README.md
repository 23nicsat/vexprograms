# Vex Programs
Collection of programs for the Vex Coding Team.

Use the *testing* branch for any code that hasn't been fully tested and approved, or for
experimenting.

Copy the code that you want to use into the Vex Program, then once you are done, add it back into the file.

If one of the coding files has any bugs, make sure to go to the *Issues* tab and open an issue. Make sure to
go to the right, click on *Projects* and add it to the **VEX Coding** Project.
Once an issue has been resolved, click the *Close* button at the bottom.

The [VEX Coding Project](https://github.com/rockwayrobotics/vexprograms/projects/1) has a list of things that need to be done, are being
worked on, and that have been completed.
If you are working on a *To Do task*, click and drag it over to the *In Progress* tab. If you are no longer working on it, move it
back over to the *To Do* tab. If you have fully completed a task, move it to the *Done* tab.

If you think that the code is finished and bug free, then submit a pull request to merge it into the main branch.
